Pandas is a very powerful open source data analysis and manipulation tool .  
In this Repository you can find Jupyter Notebooks on Pandas you should work on together as **Pair-Programmers**. 
Furthermore, there are two Notebooks on Numpy - used for numerical computing with Python. 

## Objective

At the end of this repo you should 
- understand why Pandas is a valuable tool for Data Analysts
- be familiar to handle data in Pandas DataFrames 
- know how to combine datasets
- be able to do some EDA on a new dataset
- know how to plot some basic plots for better data understanding
- have gained first insights into Numpy and Numpy-Arrays

## Task 
Please make sure you have **forked** the repo and activate your nf_base environment in VS Code.

This repo covers:

- [Introduction to Pandas](1_pandas.ipynb)
- [Practice Pandas functionalities](2_pandas_practice_1.ipynb)
- [Introduction to Pandas visualization](3_pandas_visualization.ipynb)
- [Practice Pandas functionalities and visualizations](4_pandas_practice_2.ipynb)
- [More Pandas practice and EDA](5_pandas_practice_3.ipynb)
- [Combining DataFrames](6_combine_dataframes.ipynb)  

You can work on the three following Notebooks as Extra Credit task, meaning that if you don`t have the time you can come back to it later during the course:  
- [Introduction to Numpy](EXTRA_7_numpy.ipynb)
- [Practice Numpy functionalities](EXTRA_8_numpy_practice.ipynb)
- [Extra Credit Pandas exercise](EXTRA_9_pandas_practice_4.ipynb)
